# A Git Murder Mystery
A murder had been committed in Git Town!

To solve it you'll need to muster all your `git` knowledge (or just google a bunch).

## Instructions
Clone this repository (this isn't meant to be solved using GitHub's interface):
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ssrathi/git-mystery.git
$ cd git-mystery/
```
Then follow the instructions in `instructions.txt`.

The mystery was built so that solving it can be done with `git` commands and `git` commands alone.
If you want a `git` way of reading the instructions, try:
```bash
git cat-file blob HEAD:instructions.txt
```

Once you have found the killer, send it to Shyam by email (shyam.rathi@nutanix.com) or on Slack (Shyam Rathi).
Do add the steps and commands you used to find the killer.
